## Business Requirements
### Background
Market Analysis is crucial for understanding consumer preferences and behaviors, thereby improving marketplace strategies. This project focuses on customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and delivery performance analysis using OLIST E-Commerce data.

### Business Problem
The project seeks to address challenges such as customer retention, delivery performance enhancement, and sales prediction accuracy, particularly concerning geographical factors.

## Overview of Data
### Data Sources
The project utilizes datasets related to orders, products, customers, and geolocations obtained from OLIST E-Commerce. Data cleaning processes were undertaken to handle duplicates and missing values.

## Data Exploration Analysis
Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into payment patterns, correlation between order price and freight value, and trends in sales data.

## Details of Modeling Strategy
The project employed two modeling strategies: time series forecasting using Auto regression and customer segmentation using K-means clustering based on RFM analysis.

### Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting involved Autoregressive (AR) modeling to predict future sales behavior based on historical data.

### Customer Segmentation Using K-means
Customer segmentation was performed based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using K-means clustering.

## Insights and Conclusions
The project's methodology provides a data-driven approach to business strategy formulation, especially in customer segmentation and quantitative marketing analysis. Key insights include the identification of customer segments for targeted marketing strategies and sales forecasting for informed decision-making.
